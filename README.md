This code lets you use use a downloaded, already trained, face landmark detection model and use it to detect facial traits.
Then, using a mathematical expression, it allows you to know to which extent the eyes are open or closed.
With those data, you then give signals to the driver (buzzer and lights). If the driver is still sleepy, the gps module gets the location of the driver and the gms module tranfers that location to someone.
Ps : the code is written in Python and you have to download the 64 landmark facial detection model for this program to work.
